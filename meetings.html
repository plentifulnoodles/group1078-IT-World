      <h2>Meetings</h2>

      <p>Group: As can be seen in the Tools section of this report, we were able to equally divided the tasks amongst ourselves in accordance with each of our strengths. Based on our results we were able to compare against each other and come to an agreed conclusion for which tasks were to be delegated by which members. The GitHub commit trail and meeting Actions document both reflect this and allow us to see what tasks were undertaken by each member. What could have been improved was completing some of the assignment tasks in advance. There could have been the chance to have done an interview on an IT professional, but as time was running out, there was not enough time to have found an IT professional to interview, nor there was time to come up with questions for that IT professional to answer. Had we done this, we would have avoided the long task to research 5 IT professionals, which we divided it up to make it easier amongst ourselves. As a group we could work more on our time management skills to ensure that we are more prepared in instances like this and allow ourselves to continue to meet the goals of the project effectively. Overall, we have been able to submit on time and as soon as we were satisfied with the content we had produced. We have been able to learn together as a group what our strengths and weaknesses may be and have utilized these skills to our advantage. Our goal for the next project will be to encourage each other to meet our deadlines on time and work as effectively as possible within the given time frame.
      </p>

      <p>Kye: I believe delegation of tasks early in the project worked well for us as it gave each of us a set of responsibilities to adhere to. Without completing these tasks we would each be letting the team down, which we did not want to happen, so we all made sure we tried to meet deadlines that we had set for ourselves. One thing that could be improved is our time management towards the final week of the project. We still submitted appropriately and on time however I believe we could have saved ourselves some stress by focusing on other sections of the report earlier in the assignment. One thing that I found surprising was how fast this project has come and gone. It seemed like just yesterday that we had started this group work and now we have finished a rather large report with plenty of content that I did not think was possible within our timeframe. Something that I have learned about groups whilst completing this project is that we are all quite busy people outside of university and it was always a struggle to make sure everyone’s schedules aligned for the group meetings.
      </p>

      <p>Regi: The allocation of tasks and discussions were helpful and contributed into the completion of the assignment. Sound communication with the completion of the tasks was needed to recognize what tasks were to be completed towards the overall completion of the assignment. However, timing of completing tasks could have been better. Initially, we could have initiated an interview with an IT professional as part of the requirements for the completion of the assignment. However, as we were short on time, we resorted to completing research on 5 IT professionals instead. If we had dedicated more time with the parts of the assignment in advance, we could have found a professional sooner rather than later. What I found surprising was with the difficulties we faced in completing the task, our group still managed to pull through. With the shortage of time left, we still pulled through into the completion of some parts of the assignment. And that makes me learn a lesson that whenever everyone is focused on a goal, when every member sticks to a plan with no shortcuts, they stick with that plan with a goal in mind to complete a task no matter what difficulties that may lie ahead.
      </p>

      <p>Franco: The assignment delegations for each team member has provided a necessary rigid structure for myself to personally commit to certain self-assigned hurdle tasks that would act as important micromanagement for the larger assignment and has been an insurmountable and underrated concept and tool throughout the 4 weeks of this assignment. During the initial phases of the project has been a rocky start, but has stabilised into a smooth and silky ride for the remainder of the 2 weeks of working on the project. Given the unforeseen infection I have contracted, the rough delegations have been a very important and necessary foundation as it gave rough guidelines even when circumstances have made it difficult to go through. Constant communication during the project has also been an important aspect, with people having busy lives outside of the university curriculum. It has allowed us to stay in touch and update necessary personal events so that each member can adapt to the new environment with the other present team members, despite the unexpected issues that we have encountered as a group. Overall, the management with my group mates has been a surprisingly pleasant experience that has allowed me to work in foreign environments.
      </p>

      <p>Janssen: The team delegations of the tasks were really helpful for me personally to keep track of what everyone was doing and for the completion of the assignment. Great communication overall with everyone in the group in order to complete our tasks within the set deadlines. However, meeting those deadlines were quite lackluster and could have been better. Initially, as a group we were set on doing our interview in person, however, due to unforeseen circumstances we could not get an interviewee in time as the group member delegated to get the interviewee was struck with a cold. As we were short on time, we had to make do with what we had and eventually carried our own weights and pulled through, surprising me as there were a lot of things that needed to be covered individually and everyone in the group completed what was needed to be done in such a short amount of time. Overall, I have learnt that time management in group work is really crucial as everyone lives different lives and unforeseen events do happen, so to combat that, as a group we have to plan ahead more efficiently to meet our deadlines.
