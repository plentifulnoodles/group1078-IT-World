            <p>Hello! My name is Regi Cruz, my student number is s394256. I am a first-year student studying at RMIT, enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born and raised from the Philippines on the 28/08/2003, but spent most of my childhood back in Dublin, Ireland. It was only until 2010 that my parents decided that we started a new here in Australia and I have lived here ever since for the past 12 years. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming on my laptop, I do love singing in my spare time (and when no one is watching) and I normally just enjoy reading sometimes. My interest in IT sparked whenever I decided to play video games as a young child. As I grew, I began to have an interest and understanding in how devices and technology generally worked. By the time I started year 10 at my high school, I chose Computing as a subject, where I was introduced and experienced coding with python, databases with Microsoft Access and Spreadsheets. I enjoyed it and continued to go along with that subject in Year 11 and 12, where I also learned about project planning with Gantt charts various other topics.

            <p>Hi, my name is Kye Cisternas, and I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. My father is originally from Chile in South America and moved here when he was 10 years old to start a new life with his parents and siblings.  My mother was also born in Australia with mostly Scottish ancestry. As an avid world traveller, I have been able to see some incredible things. From riding a camel and attending a traditional Bedouin campsite in Dubai, to witnessing the active volcano Kilauea erupting in Hawaii. My most memorable moment, however, would have to be visiting the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, USA. I am always in awe at the scale and vastness of outer space so getting to see and touch a rock from the moon and the space shuttles was such an unforgettable experience. I have also recently found a new albeit expensive hobby in collecting limited sneakers. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT however this is not my first degree at this institution. After graduating high school, I pursued an Advanced Diploma of Building Design (Architectural) as I had a keen interest in Architecture and the built environment. I successfully completed this two and a half year course, however I began to realise that the work and industry was not what I was expecting. I decided to abandon that pathway and shift my focus to the world of Information Technology. My interest in IT began at an early age. I remember always being excited when my dad allowed me to use his computer to play games or browse the internet via dial-up, or even watching my favourite childhood shows on a VCR video tape. Simply being able to watch the transitions from VCR to DVD to now being able to instantaneously stream makes me wonder what else the world of IT has in store for us.

            <p>Hello, My name is Franco Celis, identified as s3947046. I am currently in my first-year studying for a bachelors in Information Technology as part of my course. I hail from the Philippines, having myself and my biological parents born there. I have been introduced to the expansive world of IT when moving to Australia, having opened many wild ideas and scenarios about working in that respective field. However, I am still very new to the landscape of making creations within this world, as opposed to consuming it- so the concept is something I am excited about delving deeper into. I currently enjoy chess as a favourite pastime of over a decade, having obtained several medals and won championships over the years, both in Australia and overseas, and a distant hope to represent Australia at least on the national level, if not international. I currently work on art as a freelance hobby, being one of the other pastimes that I actively try to advertise and improve, as it acts as a sporadic burst of motivation.

            <p>Hi, my name is Janssen Cabanada, I am 18 years old and was born on the 17/02/2004. I was born in the Philippines and moved here in Australia in 2005 when I was 5 years old. I am currently studying my first year in RMIT enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology and my student number is s3946837. I have spent most of my childhood in Australia and can speak a little bit of my native language. Whenever I have time to spare, I enjoy gaming on my computer and my favourite game is “League of Legends”, which I have been playing since 2011. It was through gaming that my interest in IT began as I wanted to know how games were being made and programmed and the mechanics and logistics of a mouse and keyboard. I chose computing as a subject in year 11 and 12 and learnt to use Gantt chart, learning how to create projects. During year 11 I also did a little bit on Java and created a website using html without using the use of CSS and delve into a little bit of databases towards the end of year 12, using MS Access.

      </div>
      <p>The result of the protagonist would mean that I hold leadership values. I have undertaken leadership roles in the past back in high school as the school’s vice-captain for their junior and senior campus. This personality would be appropriate as working in a group will flow much easy for me, especially in the IT industry setting. This result would make me take the lead in some areas if I were in a team, also cautious and considerate with the decisions I make when working towards a certain goal and outcome as everyone’s voice matters in any major decision.
      </p>

      <p>When forming a team, I should consider those who are willing to listen and to work in accordance with the instructions I or some others give in reaching our goal. Especially, since protagonists tend to be empathic to others and focus on cooperation on not just them and the person, but with everyone in the team to get along and work together as it is better to unite and face problems and challenges together as a team rather than alone, leading them to a goal that we all share. </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>A contrarian leader correlates to how some of the other tests relate to me, with the added description of holding conflicting ideas and perspectives for long periods of time and delegating decisions to other team members. Based on my experiences, I can confirm that this is the case. Not just with group discussions, but anything conflicting in my personal life that comes up, it can make me overthink about things for a long time. While consideration of conflicting ideas is good in a group work setting, it can be a bad thing, especially with my behaviour towards others since it would be hard to come to an agreement with other members despite different perspectives from different kinds of people in a team. I can take account to this by having team members that are willing to listen to reasons from others and those who will stay on task should come the time I ever do give someone a task and a responsibility to uphold. </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Based on all the results, as an assertive protagonist from the Myers-Briggs test, a Contrarian Leader from the Leadership Style Test, and equally both using a Reflector and Activist learning style from the learning style test, it's safe to say that it was accurate in showing my overall character and personality. While this not only shows the leadership aspects that I possess, but it also shows that I am a person that would rather hold discussions first and think before committing to the act. This would be beneficial for not only myself, but for the team, affecting my whole behavior together as I would want to give the team members a say in what we do as a group, rather than doing stuff blindly with no discussion and afterthought.  Additionally, with discussion comes communication. To me, it is important, especially within a group setting where we are all working together towards one goal, tackling various tasks needed to take a step closer to finishing. </p>


      <h3>Kye Cisternas</h3>
      <div id=profileimages>
        <div class= centredimage>
          <img src="kye_consul_indepth.jpg" alt="Kye Myers Briggs Test" style="width:65%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The results of my personality and learning style tests all combine to give a fairly accurate representation of my character and particular traits. I was categorized as a Consul in the Myers-Briggs personality test, meaning I am more extroverted and observant, and tend to have a nature of ‘feeling’. The test also classed me as turbulent and a sentinel which means I tend to be self-motivated and follow a more technical rather than creative approach in projects. </p>

      <p>As a Consul, I believe I thrive when working in teams. I am very determined to meet the goals of a business and care deeply about my team members and their needs. A great strength for Consuls is that they make for extremely trustworthy employees and are very social. This loyal trait I believe is extremely invaluable and something I take great pride in. My goal when working in a team is always to get the job done efficiently and effectively as possible. I can be relied on when forming a team as communication is one of my strongest skills and being able to stay on top of the task at hand and manage routines efficiently and effectively is vital for me. I am happy to talk openly with everyone and do have very strong practical skills. I'm not afraid to take the lead in a group setting, however I am quite vulnerable to criticism which can let me down at times. </p>

          <img src="kye_learningstyles.png" alt="Kye Learning Styles Test" style="width:50%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The results of the test above are taken from LifeTrain's learning style quiz. This quiz is used to determine how we approach things and the different ways in which we all learn. The pie chart gets segmented into 4 parts that depict the learning styles of Reflector, Theorist, Pragmatist and Activist. As you can see, my Theorist and Pragmatist learning styles dominate most of the chart with the two results accounting for a combined 62%. As a pragmatist learner, I tend to be more technical and therefore abstract thinking is one of my weak attributes. I tend to think rationally and choose to learn more based on common theories and principles. Given my fairly equal split of learning styles, I believe my behaviour when working in a team would be advantageous. I may tend to take a back seat at times to observe what is going on, but once I do begin to understand I am able to work in an effective manner. With my reflector learning style, I can use the information gathered from previous experiences and observe other methods of learning to help me function in groups. My downfall may be my inability to be as open-minded as others when trying to learn something new as I prefer to focus on a more practical and theoretical approach to my work.

      </div>

      <p>These are the results of my IPIP Big Five Factor Markers test. In this test I was given a raw score alongside a score percentile to determine the strength or weakness of my personality traits in five big factors. I am a welcome addition to a team environment due to having such a high score in the fourth factor, Conscientiousness. This is reflected in the fact that I am diligent and take pride in my work and do not make irrational decisions that may negatively impact the team. I do not have a neurotic personality, therefore I would not be shy or irritable when communication is key. When forming a team I am very approachable and friendly to be around. I may not be the loudest person in the group due to being slightly more introverted, however my presence is still known and I am always open to listening. I may struggle a bit with my creativity and imagination, however I make up for this with my ability to be more technical and conventional in my approaches to work in general and in group settings.

      <p>Being an INTJ-T would define me as as one person who would naturally be inclined to function as constantly innovative and always searching for improvement, regardless of the hurdles and difficulties ahead. According to this information, I am classified as one of the rarest personalities within the 16 types, being extremely observant of any anomalies and discrepancies in ideas and immediately addressing it, being an acclaimed “rational and quick-witted thinker”. I find myself scrutinising over minute things and issues to the point of it being a constant bother, so I end up searching for solutions as fast as possible to quickly rectify this issue. Because of this, I always have myself question everything that exists, which provides its respective positive and negative outcomes. There is no such thing as right or wrong with gathering information, being an endless search of it. Having this come naturally is a great positive as part of learning as it expands the horizon for further queries with any given subject. This trait proves to be near-invaluable insight for any given team, bring one of the best researchers out there with an extensive scope and thirst for all relevant information for a given subject.
      </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Although short, this is an important learning test analysis that serves as an example to how I usually enjoy learning. The extreme skew towards kinesthetic categories is a result I find myself heavily agreeing upon, with projects that require physical contact and application to learn and complete projects. This type of learning is how I very much enjoy learning, seeing tangible and physical progress as the project ensues, thus providing a boost of motivation and energy whilst getting work done. Visual learning is also a secondary trait that I enjoy because instructions that provide graphical input gives me a guide on how a final product after a step should look like, acting as its own instruction. However, I find myself struggling with memorisation that requires visual and especially auditory instructions. Being an INTJ person, the mind is constantly racing and loses track of the smaller details, making visual and auditory instructions difficult to process if I find myself lost in thought, regarding a minute detail over something.
      </p>

      <div id=profileimages>

          <img src="franco-creativity.png" alt="Franco Myers Briggs Test" style="width:65%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This graph provides an explanation to how the creative and constructive I formulate ideas and opinions during a piece of research and/or project. I am naturally more inclined to be creative than the average person, which will prove to be a positive trait within a team, especially with tasks that require more unorthodox thinking thanks to more eccentric methods of gathering information. Boldness and curiosity are the two major aspects of creativity that I find compliment and synergise very effectively together as it allows me to reach out and push for more methods possible, if a problem has several potential solutions, I will find myself scrutinising over it by exploring all the alternatives possible, and then gauging which one appears the most effective with team consultation. Paradox in this context means that with every problem and/or solution, there will be some form of discrepancy that contradicts each other. Regardless of this however, it is paramount that I weigh in the analysis of this idea and work around the issue to see how it will pan out in any given hypothetical scenarios, and I find myself frequently deep in thought with paradoxes, being one enjoyable pastime of mine, alongside others. Perspective in this graph is what I find myself strongest at (with visual graph results to back it up), seeing through as many different lenses towards an idea as possible to formulate an effective response, appropriate to the situation.

          <img src="janssen_learning_style_quiz.jpg" alt="Janssen Learning Style Test" style="width:50%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Based on the results of the learning style quiz, I am mainly a tactile and visual learner. These results really do not surprise me as in the past I would prefer someone to teach me the ropes of a task via physically showing it to me rather than tell me about the instructions on how to do the task. I have found that I tend to zone out or sometimes forget what is told to me, so I heavily favor instructions based on someone doing it. The test results also show that I am also a tactile learner, thriving off on hands-on learning. From experience, I find this style of learning my best way of learning paired with visual learning as I have always had a knack on watching others and following along with my eyes rather than my ears, which is clearly displayed through the test, being that auditory learning is my weakest. I find it easier for me to comprehend tasks given if I am following it through observation and using hand motions. </p>

      <div id=profileimages>

      </div>

      <p>The results of my Myers-Brigg personality test accurately represent my character and my specific traits. I was categorized as an “Entertainer”, which is a person with the “Extraverted, Observant, Feeling and Prospecting” personality traits. According to the results of an entertainer, they love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. Entertainers are often very social and heavily encourage others into shared activities and partake in social gatherings. I believe that this best represents my personality as I am often very chatty and tend to uplift the spirits of those who surround me, putting everyone in a good mood and drawing most of the attention towards me. Another trait of an entertainer that I possess is to help someone talk out a challenging problem. I am always there for my friends who are wanting to talk and will happily provide emotional support and give the best advice I can. Furthermore, the entertainer trait also likes to avoid conflicts altogether rather than to address it. Personally, I really do not like conflict, whether internal or external and always try to find a solution out of it, whether resolving it in a civil manner or outright just avoiding it all together.
      </p>

          <img src="janssen_emotional-range_quiz.png" alt="Janssen Emotional Range Test" style="width:40%">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Possessing the traits of an “Entertainer” and preferring to learn and perform a task visually and tactically, I believe that my role in a team environment will monumental. When it comes to hands-on learning, I am at the peak of my ability to understand as that is how I prefer to work and I believe that I will be valuable in a team when it comes to those types of tasks. I am determined to finish any on-going tasks and goals with team members, caring deeply about them and their needs, willing to be the emotional support pillar of the team. A great strength of entertainers is to be in the spotlight, putting on a show and soaking up attention, making a simple outing a feel like a party. They also enjoy the simple things, as in having good fun with a group of friends. I believe this trait is especially valuable in a team setting as having an encouraging personality within a group is a stark contrasts to groups who have do not include “fun” into their style and are very serious, often leading to drama and conflict which entertainers likely avoid. I can be relied on emotionally as I am happy to talk openly with anyone with their issues and I will usually find ways to support them in their emotional journey. I am open to criticism and will gladly listen to any feedback given to me, harsh or not, and will try my best to cater to the needs of the person which people tend to not to accept due to their pride. I am not the best when it comes to leadership, as most leaders have to deal with conflict which I do not like, but I will try my best to lead the group in a positive direction whilst avoiding conflict as much as possible if appointed as one.
