      <h2>Industry Data</h2>

      <p>Upon looking through the Burning Glass data for the most in demand IT jobs in March 2018 we discovered the following. Regi’s ideal job as a Security analyst was not ranked in the industry data. Kye’s job as an Offensive Security Consultant (Penetration Testing) was also not ranked in the industry data, possibly telling us that security professions were and may still not be the most highly sought after when it comes to IT professions. Franco had two ideal job choices with both of them featuring in the list with Front-end Developer ranking 6th and Software Engineer ranking 11th respectively for most in demand jobs. If he had to choose one however, his choice favours Software Engineering. Janssen’s ideal job as a Software Developer/Programmer ranks 6th as well.</p>

      <h3>Skillset</h3>





      <p>The top IT-specific skills that we as a group require for our ideal jobs include proficiency in multiple operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Linux, general technical support and knowledge, experience in software programming for example C++ and Python. These specific skills that Burning Glass Technologies ranked as being in great demand in 2018 all seem to match our groups skill set and would give us an advantage when applying for roles that require them. They are all very specialised skills that we as a group would obtain via our studies and through experience working in our desired ideal roles. The most in demand skill from our groups skill-set would have to be proficiency in Microsoft Windows, followed by technical support and proficiency in both Microsoft C++ and the Linux operating system. Further down the list, Burning Glass reports that proficiency in Python is still very much in demand however not as much as the other skills.</p>

      <p>According to the generic skills popularity in 2018 from Burning Glass, in terms of set rank, Communication skills are a must and ranked high from the demand of employers. Especially in jobs where it requires communication amongst group members. This would mean that Teamwork and Collaboration is ranked second best, as while it would be good to communicate to others, in a group setting, collaboration is important as you are in a group with people with different strengths and weaknesses working towards the same goal. Problem-solving would-be 3rd best, especially within the ideal jobs each member has chosen, there is a problem-solving aspect to completing a specific goal in the career we choose to pursue. As for other general skills, Organizational skills, Writing and many other general skills in the popularity report Burning Glass provides are popular, but is scaled down as the skills are listed.</p>

      <p>According to the top Skills in Greatest Demand (specialized skills) in March 2018 from Burning Glass, the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not included in our required skill sets are “SQL”, being the top ranked IT-specific skill from the data set, “JavaScript”, second to SQL and “Java”. These IT-specific skills are the top ranked sought out skills according to the March 2018 data from Burning Glass which are not included and required within our group skill set.</p>

      <p>According to several job-seeking websites such as Indeed, Seek, Jora and even Jobseeker, Teamwork and proper collaboration with the team is integral to a functioning environment that would immensely support a cohesive and efficient process for companies to streamline their workload outputs.  Another example of important skills outside the requirements of IT is a good work ethic; necessary for any careers to progress and for companies to function. Demonstrating a high level of work ethic translates into extreme employee efficiency that can output productivity to a high degree, accelerating the progress of projects both as an individual and especially as a group. Lastly, integrity is one of the most underrated job ethics within any company, as it provides employers a good history and basis for what constitutes an effective and trustworthy employee from one who doesn’t have the same qualities, indirectly filtering bad candidates from the employee pool, as well as providing great team members for existing workers.

      <h3>Has our opinion changed?</h3>

      <p><b>Regi:</b> My opinion of my ideal job has not changed at all. Despite the hurdles and the requirements to reach my ideal job, I do mainly enjoy learning new things on the fly, even in the job that I wish to pursue, as it does provide more training and insight on how Security Analysis works. Most of all, I do also enjoy collaborating with others, not only as colleagues, but as potential friendships and connections I can use for the foreseeable future. </p>

      <p><b>Kye:</b> After browsing through the Burning Glass data, my opinion of my ideal job as an offensive security consultant has not changed. Although it does not feature as one of the most in demand career paths or fields in Information Technology, I do still personally believe that there is a bright future in the security sector. We will always require security consultants to help us protect and keep our vital and sensitive data safe. My required skillset is still very in demand and these skills would be transferrable in any IT related job.  </p>

      <p><b>Franco:</b> Regardless of the data, my opinion still remains adamant about the job, as job enjoyment is much more important to what qualifies a promising career from a dead-end job. A job in the software engineering industry is not only profitable to begin with, but also very flexible and enjoyable due to eliminating most logistical issues (as per working online), and that a couple thousand dollars of net loss would be negligible as it is offset by a great working environment and enjoyable atmosphere. It is a both a moral obligation and a technological necessity in today’s modern society as well, so members within the company must uphold these standards to keep the business and even a large community afloat. Someone has to do it, and I will gladly invest time in working for that.</p>

      <p><b>Janssen:</b> My opinion of my ideal job has not changed. This is mainly due to the fact that according to the burning glass data, the job details that it ranks in 6th in terms of demand, so it is easier for me to attain the job. Not only that, but I genuinely enjoy coding regardless of how hard it gets so it did not matter to me if the job was ranked in the top ten or the lowest.  </p>
