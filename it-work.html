      <h2>IT Work and IT Professionals</h2>
      <h3>Jeff Bezos</h3>

      <p>Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is one the of the IT professionals that has brought an impact to users of the internet, surrounding online shopping. Currently the Executive Chairman after stepping down as CEO in 1994, the 58-year-old man worked his way from starting Amazon out of his garage in 1994, only selling books around the time the business started. Overtime as the business grew in popularity and in sales, Bezos decided to allow his store to sell products aside from books alone. Currently being #2 billionaire in the world, it was not easy for Bezos to reach to this point, especially starting a company with minimal experience and little preparation from the unexpected traction Amazon would get from the people. </p>

      <h4>What kind of work is done by the IT professional? </h4>

      <p>Back when Amazon started in 1994, Bezos was new to the scene and only had little knowledge with managing the business. As such, Bezos had to figure out what products he was going to sell, eventually deciding to solely sell books at the start of Amazon’s life. It was such work in fact that Bezos himself got involved with packaging the book orders at the early stages and physically heading to the post office for delivering them to their customers for their order. Essentially, Bezos was in charge and worked on the decisions the business led to as the CEO, leaving the accounting work to his wife who had little to no experience in marking down the financial activities for the business start-up. Decisions such as opening Amazon to the public for market share for market share selling 3 years after opening the business up.</p>

      <h4>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?  </h4>

      <p>Aside from contacting customers in the early days of Amazon when it came to orders, Bezos has interacted with many other people outside his business. Such as his parents who gave Bezos $300,000 to the business as the “initial start-up capital”, which was a “fraction” of all their life savings. Bezos has had interacted with his investors in the early stages of Amazon’s time, warning them that there was a “70% chance” the investment would fail, leaving the other 30% hoping that the investment would be worth it in the long run, which it would. Additionally, Bezos has been a huge investor for other companies, even buying Google stock back in 1998, investing $250,000. It is unknown whether he has still kept the stock as it is “worth billions today”. And not even just investing, has interacted with other companies. Buying The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013. While the newspaper company was going downhill, Jeff had saved it from making the company that was once not making profit to making it more profitable again through restructuring how it operated in spreading the news to other people.
      </p>

      <h4>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?  </h4>

      <p>From investing to buying companies and restructuring their operation to make it more profitable, it makes sense for Bezos to be the #2 Billionaire in the world. As such, when Bezos is not working within his company, he would use this surplus of money on other things. For instance, Bezos has done donations for good causes, donating $2.5 million to defend gay marriage in Washington, pledging $10 billion to fight climate change, donated $200 million to the Smithsonian, the list goes on. Rather than keeping the money to himself, Bezos demonstrated his passion to cater and help others, similar to how he provides his customers with more product options as his company grew. And Amazon is not the only company he owns, back in 2000, Bezos founded a company named Blue Origin. As Bezos had an interest in space, he founded the company with the aim of creating rockets and to have people living in space and to travel through space, similar to its competitor SpaceX. And while it has not had that much activity ever since it was founded, it was only until 2015 when the company was able to successfully launch a reusable rocket, a monumental achievement for space travel.
      </p>

      <h4>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4>

      <p>As the CEO, managing what the business does would be the most challenging, especially during its early stages. When there comes high risk comes high reward, and while it seemed too perfect for Bezos as Amazon was getting along well with its customers and their sales, things took a turn for both the worse and for the best. In March 2000, the “dotcom bubble” hit, affecting all internet-based businesses, including Amazon. At the time, Amazon peaked $113 a share and from the start of the bubble until October 2002, the share price dropped to $5.32 a share. Even though it was a huge loss, a drop of 95% in stock, Bezos and his company pulled through, surviving bankruptcy. Despite the huge loss of the company from the outside, what was happening on the inside of Amazon was improving, involving a lay-off of around 1300 employees. While it was tragic for these employees to be taken off the payroll from Amazon, it was worth it in the end as it contributed to the company withstanding the obstacle that was the dotcom bubble.
