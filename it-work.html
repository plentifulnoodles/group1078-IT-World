      <h2>IT Work and IT Professionals</h2>
      <h3>Jeff Bezos</h3>

      <p>Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is one the of the IT professionals that has brought an impact to users of the internet, surrounding online shopping. Currently the Executive Chairman after stepping down as CEO in 1994, the 58-year-old man worked his way from starting Amazon out of his garage in 1994, only selling books around the time the business started. Overtime as the business grew in popularity and in sales, Bezos decided to allow his store to sell products aside from books alone. Currently being “#2 billionaire in the world” (Forbes 2022, Forbes List), it was not easy for Bezos to reach to this point, especially starting a company with minimal experience and little preparation from the unexpected traction Amazon would get from the people.  </p>

      <h4>What kind of work is done by the IT professional? </h4>

      <p>Back when Amazon started in 1994, Bezos was new to the scene and only had little knowledge with managing the business. As such, Bezos had to figure out what products he was going to sell, eventually deciding to solely sell books at the start of Amazon’s life. It was such work in fact that Bezos himself got involved with packaging the book orders at the early stages and physically heading to the post office for delivering them to their customers for their order according to SunnyV2’s video about him (SunnyV2, 2021). Essentially, Bezos was in charge and worked on the decisions the business led to as the CEO, leaving the accounting work to his wife who had little to no experience in marking down the financial activities for the business start-up. Decisions such as opening Amazon to the public for market share for market share selling 3 years after opening the business up.</p>

      <h4>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?  </h4>

      <p>Aside from contacting customers in the early days of Amazon when it came to orders, Bezos has interacted with many other people outside his business. Such as his parents who gave Bezos $300,000 to the business as the “initial start-up capital” (SunnyV2, 2021), which was a “fraction” (SunnyV2, 2021) of all their life savings. Bezos has had interacted with his investors in the early stages of Amazon’s time, warning them that there was a “70% chance” (SunnyV2, 2021) the investment would fail, leaving the other 30% hoping that the investment would be worth it in the long run, which it would. Additionally, Bezos has been a huge investor for other companies, even buying Google stock back in 1998, investing $250,000. It is unknown whether he has still kept the stock as it is “worth billions today” (Avery Hartmans 2022, para 25). And not even just investing, has interacted with other companies. Buying “The Washington Post for $250 million” (Avery Hartmans, para 28) in 2013. While the newspaper company was going downhill, Jeff had saved it from making the company that was once not making profit to making it more profitable again through restructuring how it operated in spreading the news to other people.
      </p>

      <h4>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?  </h4>

      <p>From investing to buying companies and restructuring their operation to make it more profitable, it makes sense for Bezos to be the #2 Billionaire in the world. As such, when Bezos is not working within his company, he would use this surplus of money on other things. For instance, Bezos has done donations for good causes, donating $2.5 million to defend gay marriage in Washington, pledging $10 billion to fight climate change, donated $200 million to the Smithsonian, the list goes on explained by Business Insider (Avery Hartman 2022). Rather than keeping the money to himself, Bezos demonstrated his passion to cater and help others, similar to how he provides his customers with more product options as his company grew. And Amazon is not the only company he owns, back in 2000, Bezos founded a company named “Blue Origin” according to Space.com (Space.com). As Bezos had an interest in space, he founded the company with the aim of creating rockets and to have people living in space and to travel through space, similar to its competitor SpaceX. And while it has not had that much activity ever since it was founded, it was only until 2015 when the company was able to successfully launch a “reusable rocket” (Avery Hartmans 2022, para 29), a monumental achievement for space travel.
      </p>

      <h4>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4>

      <p>As the CEO, managing what the business does would be the most challenging, especially during its early stages. When there comes high risk comes high reward, and while it seemed too perfect for Bezos as Amazon was getting along well with its customers and their sales, things took a turn for both the worse and for the best. In March 2000, the ‘dotcom bubble’) hit, affecting all “internet-based businesses” (Dan Marticio 2022, Definition), including Amazon. At the time, Amazon peaked “$113 a share” and from the start of the bubble until October 2002, the share price dropped to “$5.32 a share” (Sunny V2, 2021). Even though it was a huge loss, a drop of “95% in stock” (SunnyV2 2021), Bezos and his company pulled through, surviving bankruptcy. Despite the huge loss of the company from the outside, what was happening on the inside of Amazon was improving, involving a lay-off of around “1300 employees from its payroll” (Monica Soto 2001, para 4). While it was tragic for these employees to be taken off the payroll from Amazon, it was worth it in the end as it contributed to the company withstanding the obstacle that was the dotcom bubble.

      <h3>Bjarne Stroustrup </h3>

      <p>Bjarne Stroustrup is the pioneering engineer and best known for the fabrication of the C++ language, having made a significant contribution to the IT development industry with his technological endeavour, initially calling it “C with classes”. Not only this, but he is also a reputable author for his several writings and books regarding his C++ project which has reached critical acclaim that provides its readers with insightful ideas about the language. He himself was solely responsible for the design properties of all the language’s major installations and significant proposals of C++’s standards. Born on 30th December 1950, he is Danish-born computer scientist; currently holding the qualifications of a master's degree in mathematics, and a master's in computer science (later a PhD doctorate). Over the decades, Stroustrup has remained a prominent figure, even in his early 70s, with several international awards for his contribution to the digital society that we live in today.
      </p>

      <p>Stroustrup already had previously studied and had extensive knowledge within the IT field, considered one of the higher-ranking scientists at the time, having qualified with two masters-equivalent degrees from 1969 to 1975, and then later a doctorate degree in 1979. After this, he then started working on the programming language of C++ as a project, under the supervision of David Wheeler as his personal docent. This project was originally invented to serve as a communications thesis for a small local group and has then expanded under a now commercially international scene in the timespan of several decades, published in 1985 to the general public as shareware. Stroustrup himself has stated that compiling languages have been problematic as a teaching structure, and that the language serves as a “performance-oriented, low cost and reliable alternative; that combined with an emphasis on feedback, evolutionary progress and appreciation of real-world problems, has shaped C++”. To this day, Stroustrup has maintained the professionalism and integrity of C++ which has remained consistent throughout 30 years of development and is still being worked on to this day.
      </p>

      <p>Currently as of January 2014, Stroustrup is a technical and managing director in New York under Columbia university as his present career.</p>

      <h3>Tim Berners-Lee</h3>

      <p>Tim Berners-Lee one of the most popular computer scientists best known for his invention of the World Wide Web, having shaped the online world single-handedly by pioneering it as a necessary medium for information and ideas to be spread around in multiple groups and establishments; as he himself has stated “What happened with blogs and with wikis, these editable web spaces, was that they became much simpler. When you write a blog, you don’t write complicated hypertext, you just write text so I’m very, very happy to see that it has now gone in the direction of becoming more of a creative medium”. This was simply a project idea while working at CERN in Geneva as a concept of “’hypertext’, allowing researchers anywhere to share information”. having said and described For this substantial discovery and accomplishment, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004. Berners-Lee is not only the head director of the world wide web (W3C) as a senior overseer, he is also the co-founder of the World Wide Web Foundation (a non-profit organisation designed to make internet web access free and accessible for everyone) and is a senior researcher at MIT.
      </p>

      <p>Berners-Lee has ensured that the future of information as a whole would remain an easily accessible medium for the future of humanity alike , as quoted: “[…]We should learn to distinguish quality information and quality links. I feel that the web should be something, which basically doesn’t try to coerce people into putting particular things on it[…]”, as he himself believes that “humanity is capable of providing bad stuff [sic] over the web, just as it is communicating over so many other different media[…]. Berners-Lee published the first online website in 1990, describing what the W3C project was about in the environment of CERN and their future plans.</p>

      <p>On the 18th march of 2013, he was awarded the prize of the Queen Elizabeth Prize of Engineering for “ground-breaking innovation in technological engineering that has been of benefit to all of humanity”, awarded the Turing Prize on 4th April of 2017, and to this day has continued his innovative research in CERN, WWWF, the Universities of Oxford and Southampton, and MIT.</p>

      <h3>Mark Zuckerberg </h3>

      <p>As a computer programmer and CEO of his company, Zuckerberg deals with updating and giving directions of the company’s future.
