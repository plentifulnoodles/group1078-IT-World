      <h2>IT Technologies</h2>
      <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>

      <p> Cybersecurity. The definition of cybersecurity according to Oxford is ‘the state of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this’. It is what helps me and other users of technology and the internet safe. And there is just about nearly every measure of security created and considered and implemented into what we do with our technological devices.
      </p>


      <p> With cybersecurity, there are different approaches to how it can safeguard and protect users from threats they may otherwise not be aware of. And to understand this, Comodo explains the different ways and types of cybersecurity that currently exist and are used in today's time. One type of cybersecurity is “information security”, primarily focused on the security of “user’s private information” from criminals and malicious users looking to retrieve sensitive and personal data from users in any way they can. This can be secured through “user authentication”. 2-step verification is a great example for this, prompting users to enter a code either from their email or a text message to verify that the user is the one using the account and not any other person trying to gain access.  Another type is “Network security”, aimed at protecting the network along with the flow of information being shared within it. Examples are Antivirus software, Firewalls and even VPNs that are now commonly known and commonly advertised in today’s time. VPN’s (Virtual Private Networks) are a great example, primarily for their popularity for their advertisement, as well as their function to mask the user's connection from their original location to a different location such a different country that is a long distance away from where the user really is. Lastly, there is “Application Security”, protecting “software applications from vulnerabilities that occur” through errors and flaws of the application. These are in place to combat threats such as viruses, spyware, adware, Trojans, Ransomware. Some examples of this can be anti-cheat software in video games. While it may not look like it, these programs basically prevent any hacking and manipulation of game mechanics to gain an advantage or for whatever purpose. These are mainly implemented in popular online multiplayer games, to keep a fair and level playing field for all to compete and enjoy. Obviously, threats like Phishing emails are not as avoidable, unless the user takes note of the fact that it is a scam.
      </p>

      <p>In this current state of cybersecurity, it is sufficient protection for users to be safe in the applications they use and what information they give in the network is safe. However, as technology advances, so do the ways in which malicious hackers can find ways to disrupt and steal data from users from others for whatever reason they see fit. As such, I believe that developments are being made to improve the security for others. McKinsey claims that by 2025, $101.5 billion is projected to be spent on providers of cybersecurity applications. Also, 3.5 million more positions for cybersecurity are projected to be open in that same year. It’s safe to assume that action is to be taken for the development of cybersecurity. Meaning stronger software, stronger networks and stronger safety of information. There is talk that Artificial Intelligence could be implemented into cybersecurity applications. But that can also mean that Artificial Intelligence can be used against security applications. But of course, with any development, there are always going to be some ways people, mainly malicious hackers, can find their way hack through even the most complex security systems. Even going as far as using those already systems such as Artificial intelligence against others.
      </p>

      <p>With the development of cybersecurity, there are many factors and trends that affect the development of Cybersecurity. For instance, Tulane explains that Hackers always manage to “find new ways to access data every day. As more and more complex security systems and protocols are created, so do the many ways hackers can find a path to the data they wish to steal. And in return, more job openings would be created for more Cybersecurity Professionals to come in and help ensure that the systems are complex and secure against hackers. </p>

      <p>Knowing this huge development, not only that the hackers would be affected, both positively for those who do penetration testing on existing systems, and negatively for those who maliciously hack for whatever gain, it is also affecting the users of technologies and of the internet. As time goes on, new developments and possible applications for security are available for the public to use. Regardless, breaches of security are bound to occur, and the bigger the breach in security is, no matter if it is within a personal or business standpoint, it would be expensive and costly, especially if a big company were to suffer a loss of data.  </p>

      <p>While it would affect hackers who steal data, making them go through the complex security system and study it to come up with new ways to gain access to the data, this would affect the job market for other Cybersecurity Professionals to come in and be a part of something big and detrimental to the future of technology users that use programs and browse the internet. As previously mentioned, McKinsey projected to have 3.5 million more positions of cybersecurity jobs. This would play into the development of new cybersecurity applications being developed and possibly take out some redundant applications out of the picture in some circumstances. </p>

      <p>With the development of cybersecurity, this would affect my daily life, considering that I always use technology most of the time, every day. As a user who not only browses the internet but also plays games with multiple users, overtime the development of cybersecurity would affect how I browse the web safely, and how I can play games fairly and safely with others with little to no risk, with the implementation of anti-cheat programs in some multiplayer games. </p>

      <p>As for the difference, there won’t really be one in my case, especially since I would feel safe in whatever I would do with the everlasting development of cybersecurity. In my experience, knowing that there is a program that detects cheaters and hackers in the multiplayer games that I play makes me believe that I’m in a safe and fair playing field with other users. Better security would mean a better place on the internet in some ways. Especially since I wish for a career in cybersecurity as a security analyst for my career of choice. Of course, it doesn’t necessarily mean that I’m completely safe, I would still need to ensure that whatever it is I’m doing is legitimate and safe. </p>

      <p>As for the members of my family and my friends, I believe they can get along just fine with the developments of cybersecurity, if they are legitimate with the actions they do and that they have some knowledge in how to keep themselves safe in the internet, as it is up to them that keeps them safe and determines what they do with the technologies they use daily. I just hope that they will make use of the many developments and new products of cybersecurity to their favor, as with the development comes with new threats that can appear to themselves and other users of technology at any given moment.</p>



      <h3>Robots</h3>

      <p>Robots are a fascinating part of our lives and will continue to be for generations to come. There are many proposed definitions of what a robot is however what I believe to be the most fitting in today's context comes from Builtin, “a robot is the product of the robotics field, where programmable machines are built that can assist humans or mimic human actions.” Robots tend to have a few distinct characteristics to help us define and categorize them as a robot. These include being made with some sort of mechanical construction, include the use of electrical components to help control a robots movements, and last but not least at least some level of programming in order for us to tell the robot what to do and how to achieve various tasks.</p>

      <p>Robots can do so many specific tasks that us humans may find repetitive or mundane. They are known for their precision and speed and can automate tasks with little human interaction. A human may also struggle at performing certain tasks that a robot can do with ease as they are purpose built to execute these actions. </p>

      <p>Today, robots can be found everywhere, from manufacturing plants to our homes. A life without robots in this day and age would likely not be as innovative and efficient. We have made several advancements in the last 50 years in the field of robotics to get to a stage where things such as space exploration and performing surgeries are achievable. In our homes we can find robots that can help us perform household chores, such as robots that automatically vacuum, or even programmable pets for companionship.  </p>

      <p>Robots used to be utilized for mainly industrial purposes and are still commonly found in factories all around the world. We are now however using robots for a range of more complex and personal tasks such as emotional support and in the hospitality industry. We have robots performing things today that may have only seemed like something out of a movie to us recently. From entertaining us to even being able to show us to our table in a restaurant, it is exciting to see how the use cases of such an invention have rapidly changed to cater to our every needs. The most exciting and prominent advancements in my opinion would have to be the ability for robots to assist during surgeries now. Robotic surgery allows for far better precision, flexibility and control during a surgery than most conventional methods. It allows surgeons to easily view and perform complex procedures that may have been more difficult to accomplish by using their own hands and the naked eye.  </p>

      <p>The insane growth in the robotics industry over the past few years shows no signs of slowing down and the automation that comes with it will likely continue into the future. It is expected that by 2030 the sector could be worth close to $260 billion. The areas in which most of this growth is likely to happen would be areas in which our lives as humans are improved, such as delivery, transportation and cleaning. It is likely that many other robots may appear in our everyday lives as caregivers or support robots. Further developments in the medical industry with robotics are another likely prospect and something we can look forward to seeing progress in the next few years.  </p>

      <p>Our technological advancements in manufacturing and artificial intelligence or AI have made it possible to live alongside robots that improve our lives. Through a combination of programming, automation and artificial intelligence we can make robots behave in ways that we require them to. Robots need to be programmed with the tasks to perform them, therefore programming is a vital part of this technology. AI is becoming increasingly better every day and soon it may be hard to determine the difference between man and machine.  </p>

      <p>The rapid growth we have seen in technology in the last decade has transformed nearly every aspect of our day to day lives. With the rise and increased use of robots around the world we will be able to achieve much more, whether that be through space exploration, medical procedures or even companionship. We are likely to see many more robots in our homes and in the hospitality industry performing tasks we may prefer not to do. </p>

      <p>We are likely to see many more robots in our homes and in the hospitality industry performing tasks we may prefer not to do. They are becoming much more prevalent and accepted as a means of performing laborious tasks that we can program them to do. It is likely that we will see robots accomplishing things that we may not have thought of or even imagined possible soon thanks to the technological advancements that are rapidly taking place. </p>

      <p>Everyone around the world will likely interact with a robot at some point and may have already done so without even realizing. Most of the equipment we use every day such as our mobile phones, personal computers, and especially cars, were all likely manufactured with the use of robots as these tasks involved in these manufacturing processes are extremely repetitive and precise. Anyone seeking surgery in the future for the most precise and delicate of surgeries may have a robot or surgeons using robot assistants to perform their procedures. </p>

      <p>Robotics will most certainly make many current jobs redundant in the future. The field is growing so much however that it will also generate and create many more opportunities for work in other areas or in the field of robotics itself. It is predicted by business network PwC that up to 30% of jobs could be automated by robots by the mid-2030s. It is also suggested that the number of robots worldwide could reach 20 million units in the same timeframe with automated workers taking up to 51 million jobs in the next 10 years. We will most likely need to find different skills in order to work in certain industries in a few years as robots will replace humans to undertake the most physical and manual jobs. This can be seen as a positive takeaway however as manual labour is still a very dangerous industry and many workplace injuries prove to be fatal. </p>

      <p>In my own daily life, robots will greatly increase my productivity if I can acquire personal assistants that can do the mundane chores around the house that I find quite monotonous. Mini robots that vacuum surfaces already exist today however it would be exciting to see some other household robots appear to assist with other forms of cleaning, especially in and around the kitchen area. I do not believe I would find a use for a companion robot or robotic pet as I love animals and would personally rather care for living pets. </p>

      <p>It is highly likely that if I find a career in the tech industry I will come across various robots. My keen interest in the technology surrounding robotics and artificial intelligence may also allow me to work in such a field and contribute to the growth of this sector. Robotic assistants around the house would be able to benefit me in my everyday life and provide me with a way to spend more time with my friends and family whilst it automates those tasks. </p>

      <p>Robots will likely impact all of my family and friends in both their personal and professional lives. Some tend to look at robots as having quite a negative impact on their lives as they can reduce a sense of individuality and responsibility in the tasks that we perform every day. Those who work in hospitality for example may find their roles being replaced with automation and losing the authentic customer service and face to face interactions can be quite disappointing. People in favour of robots do see them as a great benefit and can see their uses enriching the lives of many already. From the robots who may be able to provide life saving surgeries, to the simple companions that we can hold a conversation with, I believe robots are the way of the future and we will likely see a dramatic increase in their numbers shortly. </p>

      <h3>Machine Learning</h3>

      <p>Machine learning is a concept where computer algorithms study and analyse user data to determine how the experience is tailored to the end user. User data collated is extensively scrutinised to imitate the way and method to how humans learn, collecting valuable information in the process, like an emulated human brain. This is to replace tedious automated thinking and processing by delegating it to robots to act as sorting machines, while humans are responsible for more complex thoughts and ideas; as shown by the current pioneering technology of notable machine learning engines (such as that in chess, during my experience). This concept is usually seen as a sub-branch of artificial intelligence, borrowing so many concepts that keep its roots of the idea, while branching out enough to warrant its own distinction. Machine learning is a new idea that utilises the ability to learn things about the world that humans cannot physically understand properly, by “teaching” computers certain patterns and examples of algorithms to apply appropriate data to new foreign concepts that have not been studied before. Computers are programmed to learn by a heavy form of pattern recognition, analysing shapes and patterns within date (for example, images of animals), and then applies its learned patterns to discern between certain animals by actively searching for notable traits. It is also applied to everyday situations such as: facial recognition, purchasing behaviour of users, text-to-speech recognition, email filtering, and viewing recommendations- to name a few. Machine learning at its peak, has been able to surpass even the most capable humans at their own cognitive thinking regarding extensive studying and networking of information. This has been refined over several years to tailor it to human experiences, from the typical daily consumer to even the most renowned experts heavily reliant on this method of learning. As an example, modern chess machines utilise a more specialised form of neural networks and machine learning, to act as an analysis engine for any given position. This project has been distilled into a capable force, to the point it bests the international champions with ease. Another form of human pioneering within this region is how search results are tailored to certain user actions, sometimes boiling down to even exact wording, to provide an easier experience for humans to shop and purchase online goods and services. From this point on, machine learning continues to expand and advance at an even faster exponential rate relative to human ingenuity. Given the technological advancement over the past years, it is no surprise that several machines have surpassed the capabilities of the human limits with ease.
      </p>

      <p>From when it was first coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel to distinguish the basic alphabet alongside the ten numbers and four special symbols, to entire infrastructures that have enabled humanity to progress further, even outside this planet. There is no downplaying these achievements, as innovation is how this concept has been extremely refined over years. There is debate whether to further improve these algorithms, stagnate their progress, or eliminate them completely; being an ethical problem for people; however, it is a story for a different era. There is no telling what machines are capable of, as with the humans that wield them. As has been observed over recent years, this technology has only been a revolutionised concept pioneered in the early 21st century, fueled by human ambition and grit. We may be able to see to it that machine learning allows us to technologically advance medicine and research in that field, to cure previously uncurable diseases and illnesses; extremely advanced methods of security such as those in banks, to immediately discern between a genuine purchase or transaction and a fraudulent one; data mining machines that can collate and study more data in a second than humans ever will in years; optimisation of projects, products, and ideas far beyond human limits; this generalised skillset allows these computers to maintain their relevance, if not dominance, over even the most skilled humans in the field(s). The development of these near-omniscient machines stems all the way back to the first computer in the 60s, taking more space than a house to barely compute even the smallest equations, while struggling in the process, all the way to massive data-crunching devices that can be easily stored in the pocket. Pioneering of this magnitude has been spread out over several decades, with a lot of ambition fueled into it as well. It is with this complex thought process that humans have been able to tailor and engineer bits of iron, copper, and silicon to construct entire infrastructures that our current world is based on. Machine learning as a concept is a relatively new topic in terms of engineering, as it requires a complex thought process of pattern recognition via user insight and data, supporting everyday decision making both for individuals, businesses, and massive corporations.
      </p>

      <p>Machine learning has proven to be an instrumental tool of success in both everyday decisions making as well as being used to create massive foundations in the IT and digital technology world. It has served as the basis of so many starting points for small companies to explode into worldwide corporations, by streamlining necessary processes and conceptualising ideas to be as efficient as possible. Even down to the most basic structure for those who are more technologically illiterate, machine learning is extremely helpful in formulating basic decisions based on what the end user necessitates. With the trajectory of machine learning’s progress, it would not be a surprise to see these devices completely outcompeting humans in most jobs due to their ruthless efficiency and near-disposable clients, as opposed to humans. People are much more fallible and more likely to sustain long-term irreparable damage, compared to the cold hardened silicon of machines. With enough automation, it can be expected to see machine learning to completely outclass even the most renowned experts within their fields due to the advanced pattern/data recognition features as well as the extensive collation of information, which no human would be able to outsource in their respective environment. This advancement would most likely see manual labour tasks eliminated from human hands completely, removing thousands, if not millions, of jobs. Machine learning in the concept of automation is a near guarantee given the trajectory of human innovation, removing the need of millions of workers. Not only this, even those who have dedicated years to a craft of skilled labour could see stiff competition within their field as machines gradually replace their thought process and cognitive thinking at a more efficient level, with ever-increasing pioneering initiatives of deep neural networks that can store more tangible information flawlessly as opposed to a more fallible human mind.
      </p>

      <p>Personally, I do not see myself heavily affected by this daunting technological advancement, at least in the near future. It’s a great testament to humankind’s progress and advancements over the eras, to which I am happy to say I am a part of and will soon be contributing towards. In saying this,  These provide great opportunities to create new jobs for those who are looking to get into the IT industry and provide a career and a financial incentive for those to further delve in, considering all things regarding the near infinite demand of online technological jobs that require some form of digital literacy. Securing myself a job in the industry will provide a massive start for my early years in the workforce, as well as following in my father’s footsteps. I will be able to work alongside him to help pioneer necessary emergency drones for the country. This close integration between family will not only strengthen personal ties, but also will prove to further my career as necessary work experience to rise in the employee hierarchy, maybe even to the level close to my father’s.
      </p>


      <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>

      <p>An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment, taking control without the need of human interaction or involvement. This means that a human passenger or driver is not needed to take control of the vehicle, nor does it not need a human to be present in the vehicle for it to operate. An autonomous vehicle is no different to a regular modern vehicle, however, unlike a modern vehicle, it completely removes the need of effort and human experience that requires you to drive that vehicle. Autonomous vehicles can completely do all the tasks a regular experienced driver can do but with greater efficiency. </p>

      <p>Through its state-of-the-art and up-to-date computer systems, complex machine learning AI allows autonomous vehicles to be separated from high-end modern vehicles in today’s society. Complex sensors all around the vehicle allow the computer system to detect its surroundings and keeps the passengers and goods inside the vehicle safe, solving the main issue involved that all regular human driven vehicles have, safety. By having state-of-the-art high tech computer systems calculate the risks and actions within the road, it completely negates human error, reducing the overall load and potential of danger and accidents that might occur. Furthermore, by allowing the computer system to take over, it can calculate the best possible routes to destination that the vehicle desires using a Global Positioning System (GPS, satellite-based radionavigation system) to accurately locate and map its destination with little to no room for error. </p>

      <p>So far, today’s modern autonomous vehicles are semi-autonomous due to safety features such as assisted parking and braking systems. Only a few so far have the capability to be fully autonomous. As autonomous vehicle technology relies on GPS capabilities and advanced sensing systems that can detect its surroundings, it isn’t fully perfected yet. Whilst autonomous vehicles can reduce human error, it is still susceptible to unknown and uncomfortable situations such as changes in the weather and updated roads. As autonomous vehicles are still in development, they are highly prone to increased risk if they are faced with sudden changes such as heavy precipitation from a clear, sunny environment or a bumpy road from a clean, smooth road, how will it react to those conditions? Furthermore, how will it adapt to everchanging traffic conditions? From bumper-to-bumper traffic, going from the open road to under tunnels or over bridges? These are the questions that need to be further tested and need to be worked upon before vehicles can be fully autonomous. While it does reduce the risk of human error by a large margin, it does not fully eradicate danger and accidents as roads can change and come in different shapes and sizes, which the vehicle might have not adapted to or is unfamiliar with, needing human input to correct.
      </p>

      <p>Autonomous cars will not only improve the quality-of-life and the safety of drivers, but also the convenience of ridesharing and fully automated transport of goods without human interaction. Elderly and physically disabled persons would have independence and will be able to travel with the need of extra assistance, vehicles can pick up missing items or transport goods effortlessly, the things that an autonomous vehicle can do are limitless. However, the real advantage of autonomous vehicles is the potential for significantly lowering CO2 emissions. As climate change is drastically impacting our planet, there is a high demand in the reduction of carbon emissions emitted by regular vehicles. If autonomous vehicles are fully perfected or are close to perfection, it can significantly lower CO2 emissions, by as much as 80% worldwide, hopefully having less cars on the road. Furthermore, other changes like the reduction of traffic congestion (up to 30%), cutting transportation costs by 40% (fuel, vehicles, and infrastructure), improving walkability and improving parking spaces by freeing up more spots. If autonomous vehicles are ready to be mass produced and manufactured by big companies, this is the improvements that a consumer would expect within the next 3-5 years, and it can only get better from there in the future.
      </p>

      <p>Autonomous vehicles are possible due to the high-end, state-of-the-art technology that runs the vehicles. Complex AI and machine learning creates limitless scenarios within seconds for the vehicle to calculate the best possible scenario for the driver and the vehicle to be in. Using this technology, there are limitless ways to use these vehicles, whether it be for transport of goods or human transport. All thanks to the complex computer system that can adapt and update to its surroundings for the best experience. </p>

      <p>The likely impact of autonomous vehicles will most likely be positive overall, with very minimal downsides as the positives heavily outweigh the negatives from a consumer standpoint. Additionally, reductions CO2 emissions will greatly impact the ecosystem of the world and greatly benefit those who are conscious about the environment, leading to more usage of the vehicles. The potential impact of the development of autonomous vehicles are limitless. Scientists and engineers will be in high demand to produce these vehicles and unemployment rates could possibly be reduced by a margin. Aside from the benefits of human convenience and lesser potential risks due to human error, there is an increase in quality-of-life and greater improvement overall to the environment. Due to this, there will be a higher demand in autonomous vehicles and will potentially dominate the automotive industry in terms of sales, creating redundancy in the manufacturing of regular vehicles  </p>

      <p>Positively, the public and those who are physically disabled to drive or are unable to catch transport will be affected greatly as it will improve the quality-of-life of those people who were restricted beforehand. However, this change will negatively affect those who have jobs specifically in the transport industry. Jobs such as truck drivers/delivery drivers, rideshare drivers and overall jobs that require vehicles as they main source of income will heavily affected if autonomous vehicles were to rise and dominate in that specific area of the market as they can realistically do whatever those drivers were doing, but with greater efficiency. With autonomous vehicles on the rise, particularly jobs will become redundant while others will be high in demand. Mechanical Engineers and Tech-savvy personnel will be in high demand to produce the vehicles and to improve its current existing technologies. On the other hand, as aforementioned, more labor-intensive jobs that require human effort, such as ridesharing and transport of goods (Truck drivers) will become redundant soon and will possibly be replaced by fully autonomous cars as it reduces the risk of accidents that are present in the industry, such as human error.
      </p>

      <p>As I have come to enjoy the likes of driving cars, autonomous vehicles will not really affect me that much personally going into the future. Don’t get me wrong, I think that autonomous vehicles are innovative, exciting and could possibly shape the future of technology but personally, it does not change anything for me as I have come to enjoy the act of driving itself and would rather put in the effort to check for my surrounding and do whatever I want with my actions rather than have a computer do it for me. During my daily life it would not affect me greatly, as I would rather have the complete freedom of using my vehicle for my purposes and be willing to put in the effort in driving it. In my opinion, getting yourself an autonomous vehicle defeats the purpose of having ownership of said vehicle. For example, if you saved up a lot of money for a car only for it to do what you can do but better, which completely defeats the purpose of the ownership, making it seem like the car owns you. Of course, this depends on the user as some people hate the act of driving or are even legal to drive, which benefits them greatly for an easier mode of transport without having the need to put in the effort that normal vehicles require. Personally, I would still rather prefer a non-autonomous vehicle when it comes to personal usage as driving establishes feelings of enjoyment and freedom that autonomous vehicles do not have. Whilst it might not affect me significantly, it will affect my friend and a close relative as they have jobs regarding transport. My cousin will be greatly affected if autonomous vehicles greatly develop soon as he works for Uber, a ride sharing company. With Uber already interested in using autonomous vehicles for its main source of transportation of patrons, rideshare drivers such as my cousin will be greatly affected and potentially land him in unemployment due to the high demand of autonomous vehicles, dominating the ridesharing industry. Another victim that would fall to the rise of autonomous vehicles is my close friend, who is a soon-to-be truck driver. With demand for autonomous vehicles in relations to the transport of goods and services, truck drivers would fall out of commission, making the job title redundant and overall making lots of people unemployed.
