      <h2>Project Idea – Adaptive Chess Engine</h2>

      <p>This chess idea mainly borrows from the major ideas of the MAIA chess engine, it being a new formalised concept of machine learning designed to mimic people as closely as possible, both in moves played and a transparent thought process. It will act as a neural network that automatically adapts to a user’s skill level by using the first couple of games to gauge the relative skill of the human player, and respectively adapts itself to play at that level in order to provide as equal of a challenge as possible. The main goal of this engine is to adapt to the relative skill level of the user as its primary goal without the requirement of any form of difficulty slider, and the secondary goal is to emulate the human-like moves based on a massive database of millions of collated non-expert level games, even to a rudimentary level of playing to demonstrate the capability of algorithmic machine branch learning. The purpose of this proposed engine is to provide inexperienced players with a form of coaching that acts as an adaptive coach to allow players to play freely, while having as accurate of a playing an opponent of equivalent skill as possible. It is a deviation from the typical chess engine that usually specialises in brute force analysis and/or known database tables to analyse certain positions to determine a result, but rather a more sophisticated form of engine analysis that adapts with its respective player to provide insight relative to the skill level. As chess is such a renowned international hobby with several hundreds of millions of players that partake in it to some degree, having an easy to access interface for beginners and competitive players alike will prove a valuable asset for the chess world to further encourage the pursuit of chess as a productive and enjoyable hobby, by both improving social connections, logical thinking, or even just beginning a new hobby at all.

      <p>This chess engine effectively acts as a neural network of machine learning, that will work alongside a database of all downloadable chess positions. This neural network is an example of an adaptive program that utilises learning after every game it plays, adjusts its relative skill level to the player, and stabilises the relative skill level against the machine’s opponents. As artificial intelligence is growing by the day, this allows the ever-growing technological advancements to even more closely emulate gameplay of those of humans, acounting for the several playing styles within the game to provide variety that would previously have not been visible within the cold brute-force analysis of raw computational power. This concept of an attenuated chess engine that is capable of not only emulating human-like gameplay, but also attempting to branch out to said different playstyles in order to provide some form of variety to the player. According to several studies by the MAIA chess engine, there is “a method of conceive a style relative to those of a certain rating threshold, and thus can be captured in a machine learning model” and would make it very much possible to even mix in best and worst moves to provide a form of authenticity that is seen with real human players, via speculative prediction and a rough algorithm that can be translated into the machine’s automated learning. This conceptualised engine will borrow the same principles of a neural network engine such as that of Alpha-Zero and Leela-chess Zero, by evaluating the apparent value of a piece within a given position, and then weighs the position of each player’s position in a spectrum that prefers one colour over the other in a numerical graph. For each example of a move played, the application will make use of alpha-beta pruning, analysing each move by quantifying its apparent value over a spectrum from the worst to best objective move, and then triangulating in between to decide which moves emulate those of a human). Due to human fallibility within the environment of chess, it is paramount that this engine is to be capable of understanding the positions by pruning out even the best moves, in substitute for the most human-like moves, by gauging it with the initial couple of games with the chess player, as well as the millions of games from already recorded games as a basis of measurement.

      <p>In order to properly code this, the team must be familiar with the basic forms of chess rules, according to official FIDE guidelines; as well as a good repository that contains both databases borrowed from Stockfish NNUE’s game database, and behaviours as that located within the neural network chess engines. This will require some form of application design to compile this entire program into both a simple website GUI, and further worked on into a dedicated downloadable application that allows all users to utilise this software anywhere at any time. This will utilise an external application and chess GUI called nibbler to act as a placeholder interface to borrow for displaying the chess board, as well as the analysis behind each analysis branch. AI systems have issues that are inhuman relative to their more fleshy counterparts, a step to closing this distance is to have the capability to manage the machine to learn the necessary and appropriate skills that can code its learning to model the actions and thinking patterns that are closest to human error and overall behaviour, which will require a large amount of filtering and supervision by the team members to ensure that the engine’s relative skill level does not exceed too far above or below its opponent, while matching the relative skill level as close as possible.
      </p>

      <p>Once the project has been finalised to its entirety, the project will consist of its own hand-crafted GUI, engine, as well as website all compiled into one program to be as compact and simple as possible. This will be implemented throughout RMIT and any other education establishments or public groups willing to collaborate together to support the project to allow both students, staff, and general users to further work and enjoy their hobby as a casual or competitive chess player. This project, once pioneered and extensively engineered, will further advertise and revolutionise the chess scene within the education department, and to demonstrate the logical capabilities and prowess of the students as competent and innovative chess players to the public, eager to compete at much higher levels to represent RMIT. This engine is planned to be heavily implemented locally within the university to act as a teacher and/or player. The infrastructure of this program is to be extensively reliant on the Python language as it provides an easy translatable skill from both the curriculum and merging with the requirements of projects and assessments, providing a valuable time-efficient skill as per complimentary coding language proficiencies learned throughout the semester.
